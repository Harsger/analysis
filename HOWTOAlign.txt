Alignment of Detector Data in the CRF Coordinate System

before alignment check for noisy and dead channels

angles are given as slopes ( angle = tan(theta) )

0. start coarse alignment with simultanious adjusting X, Y, Z and angleZ from inital iteration
1. finetune agian the values after second iteration
2. if slopes and means for intial values are near zero ( Y and Z order of 10 to 50 microns, angleZ 10e-5) finetune angleX and angleY
3. after each iteration check (and if necessary adjust) Y, Z and angleZ

largest error on X (very depending on efficiency and CRF hitdistribution)

X       : add           mean of normalized X distribution ( dethits->projectX / CRFhits->projectX )
Y       : subtract      residual mean
Z       : add           slope deltaYvsMDTslope
angleX  : add           slope deltaZvsMDT_Y
angleY  : subtract      slope deltaZvsScinX
angleZ  : subtract      slope deltaYvsScinX


alternative X :
stripdifference of stereo layers as function of scinX => fit with [1](x-[0]) => [0] = X
